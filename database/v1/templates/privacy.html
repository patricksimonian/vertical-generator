    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>For more clarity on how we use and protect your personal information, please go through our privacy policy thoroughly. Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time without notice. To make sure you are aware of any changes, please review this policy from time to time.</p>
    <p>The privacy practices of this statement apply exclusively to our services available under the domain and sub-domains of our website and apply generally to our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries or joint venture websites. By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our website.</p>
    <p>By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms & Conditions Agreement while registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance during registration, and is otherwise effective on carrying out any transaction with us for all users.</p>
    <p>In the course of registering for and availing various services we provide from time to time through our website (Website, telephone search, SMS and WAP) or any other Media medium in which we may provide services, you may be required to disclose your name, residence address, email address, telephone number and similar Personal Information.</p>
    <h2>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT:</h2>
    <p><strong>1.1</strong> The Personal Information is used for two general purposes: billing purposes and order fulfillment. Your personal information is also used in order to provide you with the best possible services. If we have trouble processing an order, the contact information is used to get in touch with the user. Your phone number is never sold or rented. Unless otherwise stated explicitly, this Policy applies to Personal Information as disclosed on any of the Media.</p>
    <p><strong>1.2</strong> In furtherance of the confidentiality with which we treat Personal Information we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session.</p>
    <p><strong>1.3</strong> Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a user, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.</p>
    <p><strong>1.4</strong> If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Website, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.</p>
    <p><strong>1.5</strong> You acknowledge that you are disclosing Personal Information voluntarily. Prior to the completion of any registration process on our website or prior to availing of any services offered on our website if you wish not to disclose any Personal Information you may refrain from doing so; however if you don't provide information that is requested it is possible that the registration process would be incomplete and/or you would not be able to avail our services.</p>
